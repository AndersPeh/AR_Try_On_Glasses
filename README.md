Hey there! Welcome to FrameXperience, a fun and handy Augmented Reality (AR) app that lets you try on glasses right from your phone. No more awkward trips to the store or squinting at blurry selfies—FrameXperience brings the eyewear shopping experience to you, wherever you are.

This app is built for Android devices and uses your smartphone camera to let you see how different glasses look on your face in real-time. It’s all about making the hunt for the perfect pair simple, interactive, and maybe even a little entertaining.

What Makes It Awesome Here’s what you can do with FrameXperience:

Real-time Virtual Try-On: Pick a pair of glasses and see them on your face instantly—no mirrors required! Markerless AR Tracking: No clunky markers or extra setup. The app uses your phone’s camera to figure out where the glasses should sit on your face. Works Offline (Sort Of): You can browse and try on glasses without Wi-Fi, though you’ll need a connection to see store info and prices. Store Details: Check out pricing and which optical stores carry the frames you’re eyeing. A Little Fun Twist: Try on at least three frames from four shapes (like rectangle or round), and you’ll score a $5 voucher. Shopping and rewards? Yes, please! Smart Suggestions: The app’s AI gives you recommendations based on the frame shapes you seem to like. The Tech Behind the Magic Curious about what powers this? Here’s the rundown:

Unity Game Engine: The foundation that makes everything run smoothly. AR Foundation: A Unity tool that helps us bring AR to life across different devices. Google ARCore XR Plugin: Adds extra AR oomph for Android, like tracking your face and surroundings. 3D Models: Super realistic glasses designs so you know exactly what you’re getting. Database: Keeps all the glasses and store info organized. Rule-based AI: A simple but clever system to suggest frames that match your vibe.
